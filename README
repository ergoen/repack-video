Application to repack video from mkv to mp4 and reencode audio to stereo aac.

INSTALL
Download neroAacEnc and put it into the same directory as the script.
(http://www.nero.com/eng/downloads-nerodigital-nero-aac-codec.php)

ADDING TO RIGHT-CLICK MENU
Run regedit.
Go to HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shell.
Add a new key "repack".
Inside that add another key "Command".
Change the value of the "(Default)" string value to the scripts location with a "%1" behind it, like:
"U:\repack.bat" "%1"
Now you can right click on any file and press repack. (Will only work on mkv-files with h264 video in them though)

MANUAL USAGE
repack.bat filename.mkv
